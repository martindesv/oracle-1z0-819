## Working with Streams and Lambda expressions

Source -> Intermediate operation -> terminal operation

s -> true is valid.

() not required on left if there is only one variable. {} not required if right side is a single expression. Parameter data types only required if it data type for at least one parameter is specified; otherwise none are required.

UnaryOperator and BiFunction return a generic argument, such as Double. All predicate functions return boolean.

Supplier doesn't take input, Supplier doesn't return data.

Stream operations don't affect the original list.

Terminal operation triggers the pipeline to run.

LongConsumer has accept(). LongSuppler has getAsLong(). LongFunction has apply(). LongPredicate has test().

sequential() - equivalent sequential stream of an existing stream.

parallel() - equivalent parallel stream of an existing stream.

Passing null to of() throws NullPointerException.

Supplier<Double> can return null. DoubleSupplier can't.

anyMatch() returns a boolean. findAny() might not return first element.

String::new is equivalent to () -> new String()

The lambda (s, p) -> s + p takes two generic arguments and returns a value. BiConsumer doesn't return any values. Function takes one argument and returns a value.

Reduction - a terminal operation where a single value is generated by reading each element in the prior step in a stream pipeline.

Atomic numeric instance is thread-safe.

filter() returns zero or one element. flatMap() returns zero or more elements. map() returns exactly one element.

long can be implicitly cast to double.

ToDoubleBiFunction<T, U> takes two generic inputs and returns a double.

Function<Integer, ArrayList> func = (n) -> new ArrayList<>(n);

Function<Integer, ArrayList> func = ArrayList::new;

On a DoubleStream average() and max() return OptionalDouble.

BiPredicate takes two generic arguments and returns a boolean. DoubleUnaryOperator and IntUnaryOperator transform values of types double and int. ToLongFunction takes a generic argument and returns long.

ObjDoubleConsumer, ObjIntConsumer. Object is abbreviated to Obj in java.util.function
