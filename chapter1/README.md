## Working with Java data types

Variable name can't be a single '_', can't begin with a number. Must begin with a letter, $, _

reverse(), insert() only on StringBuilder, not String.

charAt(), length() on both StringBuilder and String.

StringBuilder is mutable, methods return a reference to the same object. String is immutable.

3.14 is double. Requires casting or writing 3.14f to be a float.

/, %, * same operator precedence

var must be used for all lambda parameters, if it used for any.

When calling print, toString() is automatically called.

var color - without a value not allowed.

_ allowed between two digits.

Objects allowed to be null, primitives not.

sb.delete(1, 2) deletes starting at 1 and before 2.

Pay attention if value changes or result of operation is ignored.
