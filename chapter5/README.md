## Working with Arrays and Collections

When using array initializer with braces {}, it is not allowed to specify size separately.

? can't be used when instantiating a type on the right side of =

Empty 2D array with dimensions 2x2:

int [][] blue = new int[2][2];

If lookup by key, use map. LinkedList is a Queue.

To sort the longest strings first:

public int compare(String s1, String s2) { return s2.length() - s1.length(); }

Arrays.binarySearch() returns positive int if match is found.
